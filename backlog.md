# VisualOS Backlog

This document tracks all planned features and enhancements for the VisualOS signage management system.

---

## Project Overview

**VisualOS** is a signage project management tool that integrates with:
- Xero (project and customer data)
- Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive)
- Synology NAS (file storage)

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Express + Postgres + Prisma (TypeScript)
- Frontend: React + Mantine UI (Vite)
- Deployment: Docker on Synology NAS (BE: `vis.vil.nz`, FE: `visualos.vil.nz`)
- APIs: Xero, Google (Gmail, Calendar, Drive)

**Current Features:**
- Xero project import + sync (INPROGRESS + CLOSED only — Xero API does not support DRAFT filter)
- Project phases: Design → Quote → With Customer → Production → Install → Invoice (New removed from Kanban)
- Notes system (rich text editor)
- Email integration (Gmail threads via `studio@vil.nz`)
- Kanban dashboard view with drag & drop (status updates via PATCH, optimistic UI, drop zone highlighting)
- Toast notification system (`@mantine/notifications` + reusable `notify` utility)
- Docker hot-reload for development
- Design approval system (internal): Drive file picker, version history, approve/request changes, per-version and project-level tasks
- Task management: reusable TaskList + TaskModal components with assignee, due date, priority, status
- URL-synced project tabs (React Router)
- My Tasks page: grouped/sorted/filtered task view, standalone tasks, sidebar badge with incomplete count
- Contacts system: full Xero sync, webhook, local DB, contacts list + detail pages
- Drive folder picker: link a Google Drive folder to any project (backend drive-token endpoint, stored per-project)
- Drive folder picker smart defaults: project picker opens in client's Drive folder; Brand Assets picker opens in system base folder
- Admin role: `isAdmin` flag on User; bren + bev seeded as admins
- System Settings: single-row `SystemSettings` model stores base Drive folder (admin-only Settings page)
- Persistent sessions: `connect-pg-simple` PostgreSQL session store — logins survive backend restarts/rebuilds
- Silent Drive token refresh: `getDriveAccessToken()` utility + `/auth/drive-token` backend endpoint
- New Project button in sidebar, Home page, and contact detail page (contact pre-fills form)

### 4. Google Drive Design Approval System - Phase 2 (Customer-Facing)
**Status:** 📋 Planned  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** `feature`, `google-api`, `customer-facing`, `high-priority`, `security`

**Description:**  
Phase 1 (internal approval workflow) is complete and shipped. Phase 2 adds the public customer-facing flow with magic link emails and token-based authentication.

#### Workflow

**Phase 1 (complete):** Internal team can upload Drive PDFs, assign version numbers, approve or request changes, and manage per-version and project-level tasks.

**Phase 2: Customer Flow**
1. Team member sends design to customer from VisualOS
2. Email sent to customer with tokenised review link (magic link)
3. Customer views PDF in browser (embedded, no download)
4. Customer clicks "Approve" → confirmation email with 6-digit code or second magic link
5. Customer confirms → design marked approved, project moves to production

---

### 11. Global App State with React Context
**Status:** 📋 Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `architecture`, `ux`

**Description:**  
Currently some state (e.g. task count badge in sidebar) is fetched independently per component with polling. A shared React context would allow components to reactively share state without redundant API calls or polling.

**Initial candidates for global state:**
- Incomplete task count (so ticking complete in MyTasks instantly updates sidebar badge)
- Logged-in user object (currently re-fetched in multiple places)
- Potentially: active project, notifications queue

**Proposed approach:**
- Create `AppContext` (or separate contexts per domain e.g. `TaskContext`, `UserContext`)
- Wrap app in provider in `App.tsx`
- Expose update functions so child components can push state changes up

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `UserContext` providing logged-in user across app
- [ ] `TaskContext` providing incomplete task count, updated optimistically on status change
- [ ] Sidebar badge updates instantly when task is completed in MyTasks page
- [ ] No redundant API calls for shared data

---

### 12. Vitest Setup (Backend)
**Status:** 📋 Planned  
**Priority:** Low  
**Labels:** `testing`, `infrastructure`

**Description:**  
Unit test infrastructure for the backend is not yet configured. `contactRoutes.test.ts` has been written but can't run until vitest is installed and configured.

**Steps:**
- `npm install --save-dev vitest`
- Add `"test": "vitest"` to `package.json` scripts
- Run existing `contactRoutes.test.ts` and fix any issues

---

### 13. Fix Vitest ERR_REQUIRE_ESM in Frontend
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Priority:** Low
**Labels:** `testing`, `infrastructure`, `frontend`

**Description:**
The frontend `npm run test` suite fails at the vitest step with an unhandled `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` error. `html-encoding-sniffer` (a jsdom dependency) is trying to CJS-`require()` `@exodus/bytes/encoding-lite.js`, which is now ESM-only. This causes vitest to abort before running any tests.

**Error:**
```
Error: require() of ES Module node_modules/@exodus/bytes/encoding-lite.js
from node_modules/html-encoding-sniffer/lib/html-encoding-sniffer.js not supported.
```

**Steps to investigate:**
- Check if pinning `@exodus/bytes` to an older CJS-compatible version resolves it
- Or upgrade `jsdom` / `vitest` to a version where the dependency chain is compatible
- Run `npm run vitest` after fix to confirm tests execute cleanly

---

### 14. Remove `xeroContactName` from Project
**Status:** 📋 Planned — Cleanup  
**Priority:** Low  
**Labels:** `refactoring`, `database`, `cleanup`

**Description:**  
During the contacts migration, `xeroContactName` and the old `xeroContactId` were retained on the `Project` model for safety. Now that contacts are fully linked via `contactId` FK, these columns can be dropped.

**Steps:**
1. Confirm all projects have `contactId` populated (check for nulls)
2. Search codebase for any remaining references to `xeroContactName` or `project.xeroContactId`
3. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name remove_xero_contact_fields_from_project`
4. Deploy

---

---

### 17. Phone Message Feature
**Status:** ✅ Complete — PRs open for review
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** `feature`, `tasks`, `ux`

**Description:**
Quick "Take a Message" button in the sidebar lets any team member capture a phone message from any page without losing their place. The message becomes a Task assigned to the relevant person, optionally linked to a project.

**Completed:**
- [x] Prisma: 5 new fields on `Task` — `isPhoneMessage`, `callerName`, `callerPhone`, `callerEmail`, `takenAt`
- [x] Migration: `add_phone_message_to_task` applied
- [x] Backend: both `POST /tasks` and `POST /projects/:projectId/tasks` accept + persist new fields
- [x] Backend: `GET /xero/projects` Contact include extended with `emailAddress` + `phones` for auto-fill
- [x] Frontend: `PhoneMessageModal` — fetches users + all projects on open, captures `takenAt` at button-press time, auto-fills phone (MOBILE preferred, then DEFAULT) + email from project contact, submits to project or standalone task endpoint
- [x] Frontend: "Take a Message" button in sidebar (between New Project and Sync Projects)
- [x] Frontend: My Tasks shows 📞 icon, caller phone/email below subtitle, `takenAt` timestamp in place of due date
- [x] Frontend: `ITask` + `IProject` types updated

**Deferred to backlog:**
- Email notification to assignee when a phone message is recorded

---

### 18. Persistent Sessions (PostgreSQL Session Store)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** `fix`, `infrastructure`, `auth`

**Completed:**
- [x] Replaced in-memory `MemoryStore` with `connect-pg-simple` PostgreSQL session store
- [x] Sessions now survive backend restarts and container rebuilds — users stay logged in
- [x] `session` table created via `createTableIfMissing: true` (Prisma drift resolved with manual migration)
- [x] `pg.Pool` using `DATABASE_URL` wired into session store in `index.ts`

---

### 19. Silent Drive Token Refresh
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** `feature`, `google-api`, `drive`, `auth`

**Description:**
Previously the Drive folder picker required users to re-authorise via a Google popup on every session. Now a backend endpoint exchanges the stored refresh token for a short-lived access token silently.

**Completed:**
- [x] Backend: `GET /auth/drive-token` — uses `google_refresh_token` from session user, exchanges via googleapis `OAuth2Client`, returns `access_token`
- [x] Frontend: `src/utils/driveToken.ts` — `getDriveAccessToken()` calls the endpoint and returns the token
- [x] All Drive picker components (`DriveFolderPicker`, `DrivePickerButton`) use `getDriveAccessToken()` instead of GIS popup
- [x] Token errors shown as toast notification

---

### 20. Bidirectional Project → Contact Navigation
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** `fix`, `ux`, `contacts`

**Description:**
Project detail page now links back to the associated contact using `project.contactId` and `project.xeroContactName` — the same contact that appears in the contact's Projects tab.

**Completed:**
- [x] `Project.tsx`: contact name displayed as `<Link to="/contacts/:contactId">` using `xeroContactName` as label
- [x] Contact email shown alongside link when available via `project.contact.emailAddress`
- [x] `GET /api/xero/projects/:id` updated to include `Contact` relation and remap it to lowercase `contact` in response

---

### 21. Drive Folder Picker Smart Defaults + Admin Settings
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** `feature`, `google-api`, `drive`, `admin`

**Description:**
The Drive folder picker now opens in a contextually relevant default folder rather than the Drive root. Admins set a system-wide base job folder; contacts have their own folder set via Brand Assets tab; projects default to the client's folder.

**Completed:**
- [x] Prisma: `isAdmin Boolean @default(false)` added to `User`; `bren@vil.nz` + `bev@vil.nz` seeded as admins in migration
- [x] Prisma: `SystemSettings` model added (singleton id=1); `baseDriveFolderId` + `baseDriveFolderName` fields
- [x] Backend: `settingsRoutes.ts` — `GET /api/settings` (all authenticated), `PATCH /api/settings/base-drive-folder` (admin only)
- [x] Backend: `ensureAdmin` middleware added (`utils/ensureAdmin.ts`)
- [x] Frontend: `Settings.tsx` — admin-only section with `DrivePickerButton` to set base job folder; fetches current setting on load
- [x] Frontend: `BrandAssetsTab.tsx` — fetches system settings in parallel, passes `baseDriveFolderId` as `defaultParentFolderId` to the folder picker
- [x] Frontend: `Project.tsx` (`DriveFolderPicker`) — passes `contact.driveFolderId` as `defaultParentFolderId`
- [x] Frontend: `DrivePickerButton` — generic reusable component (extracted from `DriveFolderPicker`); accepts `linkedFolderId`, `linkedFolderName`, `defaultParentFolderId`, `isSaving`, `onFolderSelected`
- [x] `types/user.ts`: `isAdmin` added to `User` interface; `SystemSettings` interface added

**Drive folder hierarchy:**
```
Base Job Folder (set by admin in Settings)
  └── Client Folder (set per-contact in Brand Assets tab)
       └── Project Folder (set per-project in Details tab)
```

### 16. Drive Folder Picker for Projects
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** `feature`, `google-api`, `drive`

**Description:**
Each project can now be linked to a Google Drive folder. The folder ID is stored on the project (shared across all team members). Uses Google Identity Services (GIS) on the frontend to request a short-lived Drive token client-side — avoids touching backend OAuth scopes.

**Completed:**

- [x] Backend: `PATCH /projects/:id` extended to accept `{ driveFolderId, driveFolderName }` independently of status
- [x] Frontend: `DriveFolderPicker` component — loads GIS + gapi scripts, initialises token client lazily on click, opens folder-only Google Picker
- [x] Frontend: `IProject` type updated with optional `driveFolderId` / `driveFolderName`
- [x] Frontend: `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY` added to env files; values in `.env.development.local` and GH Actions secrets
- [x] Details tab: shows "Link Drive Folder" button when unlinked; folder name as clickable Drive link + "Change" button when linked
- [x] GCP: Google Picker API enabled; `http://localhost:5173` + `https://visualos.vil.nz` added to Authorized JavaScript origins

---

### 15. Site Survey Tab — Phase 2 (Google Maps Integration)
**Status:** ✅ Complete — pushed to master
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** `feature`, `survey`, `google-api`, `maps`

**Description:**
Enhance the Survey tab address field with Google Maps integration. No in-app map embed — keep it lightweight. Just autocomplete to resolve a clean address + coordinates, and a link to open the location in Google Maps.

**Completed:**
- [x] Google Places Autocomplete on the address field (`@googlemaps/js-api-loader` v2, `setOptions` + `importLibrary` functional API)
- [x] Selecting an autocomplete result populates `address`, `lat`, `lng` — manual typing clears lat/lng
- [x] `lat`/`lng` included in `saveSurvey` PUT payload (backend already supported these fields)
- [x] "Open in Google Maps" link button next to Save (opens `https://maps.google.com/?q=lat,lng` in new tab)
- [x] Falls back gracefully — link hidden when no lat/lng stored
- [x] `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` added to `.env.development` (requires Maps JavaScript API + Places API enabled in Google Cloud)
- [x] `@types/google.maps` added as dev dep; `tsconfig.json` updated with `"google.maps"` in types array

## Notes

- All Google API integrations use `studio@vil.nz` shared account OAuth tokens
- Database changes require Prisma migrations — use `npx prisma migrate deploy` on production (not `migrate dev`)
- Customer-facing features require public routes with token-based authentication
- All features should maintain mobile responsiveness
- Email notifications go through Gmail API via `studio@vil.nz`
- Production deploy is automated via GitHub Actions — push to `main`/`master` triggers deploy. No manual steps needed.
- Xero webhook key and tenant ID stored in `.env` as `XERO_WEBHOOK_KEY` and `XERO_TENANT_ID`

### 22. Shop Floor Workflow Viewer
**Status:** 📋 Planned  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** `feature`, `shop-floor`, `tablet`, `ux`

**Description:**  
A dedicated tablet-optimised view permanently displayed in the production area. No sidebar, no nav — just what floor staff need. Shows today's production jobs pulled from calendar events, with big tappable status toggles (Pending → In Progress → Done) suited to gloved hands. Auto-refreshes every 60 seconds. Pinned to a shop floor user session (no repeated logins). Landscape-optimised layout with a clear "What's Next" queue — overdue jobs highlighted in red, today's amber, upcoming green. Optionally shows a thumbnail of the linked Drive design file so staff can see exactly what they're producing.

**Notes:**
- Depends on Calendar Integration (#3) being complete first
- Route: `/shopfloor` — fully separate layout, no AppShell
- Session pinned to a dedicated shop floor user account
- Consider large touch targets throughout — this is a gloved-hand environment

---

### 23. Business Intelligence Dashboard
**Status:** 📋 Planned  
**Priority:** Low  
**Labels:** `feature`, `analytics`, `admin`, `reporting`

**Description:**  
Admin-only `/analytics` page surfacing business insights from existing data. Potential metrics: revenue pipeline by project stage (from Xero quote values), staff utilisation from calendar hours, average job cycle time per phase (to spot bottlenecks), top clients by project volume, and overdue installs (jobs in Install with no completed install task). Built with Recharts (already in stack).

**Notes:**
- Admin-only route, guarded by `ensureAdmin` middleware
- All data already exists in VisualOS — no new integrations required
- Low priority until core workflow features are complete

---

### 24. Field View — Install & Survey Map
**Status:** 📋 Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** `feature`, `maps`, `install`, `survey`, `calendar`, `mobile`

**Description:**  
A map-based field operations view at `/field` (or `/map`) that plots both active installs and pending surveys on a Google Map, colour-coded by type and status. The key insight: being able to visually identify clusters of jobs in the same area and batch them — "we've got 3 surveys and 2 installs all within 2km of each other this week, let's do them in one run."

Surveys should also appear as calendar events (schedule a survey from the Survey tab, same as scheduling an install). The field view brings both together in one geographic picture.

**Features:**
- Google Map with pins for all projects that have survey lat/lng coordinates
- Separate pin styles for surveys (pending/scheduled) vs installs (scheduled/in-progress)
- Filter by date range, status, and assigned staff member
- Click a pin → project summary card (client name, job type, status, assigned staff) with link to open the full project
- Optionally show drive time / distance between selected pins for route planning

**Notes:**
- Lat/lng already captured in Survey tab — existing data can populate the map immediately
- Depends on Calendar Integration (#3) for survey scheduling
- Mobile-optimised — this is a field tool, used from a phone or tablet in the van
- Uses Google Maps JS API (already enabled in GCP)

### 25. Delivery & Install Docket — Mobile Field View
**Status:** 📋 Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** `feature`, `install`, `mobile`, `field`

**Description:**  
When a job hits Install status, a mobile-optimised "docket" view is available for the installer — not a printed PDF, but a clean phone/tablet screen they reference on-site. Pulls together everything the installer needs in one place without navigating through tabs.

**Contents:**
- Client name, site address with "Open in Maps" link (uses Survey lat/lng)
- Design thumbnail from the linked Drive folder
- Install task checklist (tick off items on-site)
- Notes from the Survey tab (site-specific details the installer needs to know)
- A photo upload button to capture completion photos directly from the camera, saved to the project's Drive folder in an `Install Photos` subfolder
- Timestamped and GPS-tagged completion record

**Notes:**
- Accessible from the project detail page (Install tab or a dedicated button when status = Install)
- No new auth required — uses existing session
- Completion photos saved to Drive extend the existing photo pattern from the Survey tab
- Could eventually trigger a client completion email with photos attached (via Gmail API)

---

### 26. Client Portal
**Status:** 📋 Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** `feature`, `customer-facing`, `magic-link`, `security`

**Description:**  
A persistent (token-gated, no password) client-facing mini-portal extending the Design Approval Phase 2 magic-link pattern. Clients get a single link tied to their contact record that shows all their active projects in a clean, branded view — no Kanban complexity, just the information relevant to them.

**Portal features:**
- All active projects for the client with current status
- Design file review and approval (Phase 2 already covers this — portal integrates it)
- Scheduled install dates (from calendar)
- Completion photos after install
- Ability to raise a "change request" that creates a Task in VisualOS
- Branded using the client's brand colours from the Brand Assets tab

**Auth model:**
- Magic link tied to `Contact.xeroContactId` — no login, no password
- Token stored on Contact model, with optional expiry or rolling refresh
- Public routes with token-based middleware (same pattern as Design Approval Phase 2)

**Notes:**
- Design Approval Phase 2 (#4) should be completed first — portal will absorb that flow
- Branding via Brand Assets tab (colours, logo) — existing infrastructure
- Consider a "share portal link" button on the Contact detail page

### 27. Project Templates
**Status:** 📋 Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** `feature`, `templates`, `ux`, `workflow`

**Description:**  
For common recurring job types (vehicle wraps, shop signage, event banners, etc.), save a reusable template that scaffolds out a new project automatically. Huge time saver for bread-and-butter work where the task list, assignees, and calendar event types are predictable.

**Template contents:**
- Default set of tasks with suggested assignees and priorities
- Calendar event types with suggested durations (leverages Calendar Integration types)
- Notes boilerplate (e.g. standard checklist for a full vehicle wrap)
- Default project status on creation

**UI:**
- Templates managed in Settings (admin) or a dedicated `/templates` page
- On "New Project" — optional "Start from template" picker before the form
- Template selection pre-populates tasks, notes, and calendar scaffolding; user can edit before saving

**Notes:**
- Depends on Calendar Integration (#3) for the scheduling scaffolding
- Templates stored as a new `ProjectTemplate` model with child `TemplateTask` records
- No external integrations required — purely internal data
